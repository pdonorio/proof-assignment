## what to expect

We (both us and you) will probably learn from this little coding exercise:

- reading carefully before doing anything!
- try to be better
    + apply as many best practices as you can 
        * (that don't slow you down too much)
        * don't use `print`, use the logger `;)`
        * `introspection` is key in Python
        * check for `None` objects
    + don't overthink the issues you find
- researching a good library for your needs
    + or create your code if there is none that fits
- how comfortable you feel with using some kind of "black box" framework
    + learn to balance when to ask and when to dig to understand
    + always give feedback to make things improve
- use mongo documents mapping to python objects (`pymodm` library)
